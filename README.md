# 🐉GET NEXT LINE GUIDE🐉
## 1st step: Understanding🐉

Project name: get_next_line
Prototype: char *get_next_line(int fd);
Turn in files: get_next_line.c, get_next_line_utils.c, get_next_line.h
External functs: read, malloc, free

PROHIBITED:
- Using your libft
- lseek()
- Global Variables

BONUS:
EMPTY and I don't inteed to do it.

## 2nd step: Files🐲

The first thing I did in my projects was make 3 files:

#### get_next_line.c
Main function where get next line is going to be.

#### get_next_line_utils.c
Secondary funtions needed to run the main function.

#### get_next_line.h
Header file, this file is used to get all the libraries, buffersize, etc...

## 3rd step: Coding...🐲
